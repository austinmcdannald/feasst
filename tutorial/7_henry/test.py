# Title: Example Calculation of the Henry constant and infinite-dilution isosteric heat of
#   adsorption of TraPPE Ethane in LTA All-silica Zeolite
#
# Software Description: Calculation is accomplished via Widom Insertion to obtain N=1 state
#   spatial averages, using FEASST to generate the ghost insertions and perform energy calculations.
#   Calculation is based on the Henry coefficient calculation described in "Toward Rational Design of
#   Metalâ€“Organic Frameworks for Sensing Applications: Efficient Calculation of Adsorption
#   Characteristics in Zero Loading Regime" by L. Sarkisov, <em>J Phys Chem C</em>, 116(4):3025-3033,
#   2012 (https://doi.org/10.1021/jp210633w)
#
# Requirements: This FEASST Script uses a specific branch and commit of the FEASST
#   source code, release tag v0.6.0 (https://github.com/usnistgov/feasst/releases/tag/v0.6.0),
#   as it utilizes tutorial-specific functions. Checkout the specific release of FEASST via:
#
#   git checkout v0.6.0
