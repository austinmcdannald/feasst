E_disp - co2 - co2 and co2-mfi but not mfi-mfi

add mfi like a "molecule"

E_real - all pair real space - intra molecular coulomb

Line 3480 - oxygen crossed periodic boundary

Confirm
1. the cut off is 15 angstrom linear-force shifted
2. ewald box vectors probably have issues. alpha*minl = 5.6, k2max = 27
